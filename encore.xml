<SHOWLONG>Trevor Nunn directs Ralph Fiennes in William Shakespeare's The Tempest as the third production of his electrifying season at the Theatre Royal Haymarket.
Almost certainly Shakespeare's last play, The Tempest can lay claim to being the first ever work of magic realism.
Marooned and left to die on a remote island, Prospero can command spirits, create apparitions and manipulate the elements. By using his magic, he assembles his enemies to take revenge on them, and in the process awakens in Miranda, his teenage daughter, her first experience of love. The theme of reconciliation gives immense emotional force to Shakespeare's farewell to the stage.</SHOWLONG>

<SHOWLONG>Don't miss this year's hottest theatre tickets as two of the world's greatest living actors arrive in London to perform Alfred Uhry's timeless Pulitzer Prize-winning classic Driving Miss Daisy, in a strictly limited season.

For 12 weeks only, the Wyndham's Theatre will light up with the extraordinary talents of the legendary Oscar and Tony Award-winner Vanessa Redgrave and the incomparable, Tony Award-winning and Oscar-nominated James Earl Jones. 

David Esbjornson's acclaimed, smash-hit production has dazzled audiences and critics alike on Broadway.

Inspiration for the much-loved Oscar-winning smash-hit movie, Driving Miss Daisy is the charming, poignant and utterly compelling tale of the unlikely, long-lasting friendship that blossoms between a prickly, elderly Southern matriarch and her kind-hearted chauffeur, Hoke. 

As the wheels turn and the decades roll by against a backdrop of prejudice, inequality and civil unrest, the pair slowly transcend their differences and ultimately grow to rely on each other far more than either of them ever expected. 

Sparklingly funny, irresistibly heart-warming and with an unmissable stellar cast, Driving Miss Daisy is the must-see show of 2011 so book your tickets for this extremely limited season now!
Please Note:Vanessa Redgrave will not perform on the 25th October.</SHOWLONG>

<SHOWLONG>La Traviata - the touching story of the self-sacrificing courtesan of the title - has long been one of the most consistently loved of all operas across the world. Verdi's music is instantly appealing, with a wealth of famous melodies that allow operatic voices to soar and thrill. 
The traditional style of Richard Eyre's production for The Royal Opera in Bob Crowley's period designs has made this particular staging acclaimed and popular every time it returns. It is an opera that sweeps everyone along from the lively opening party and the instantly recognizable and tuneful toast to indulgence, through dramatic confrontations both private and public, and to the most heart-rending of tragic endings. 
This season there are fabulous casts to hear in the central roles of Violetta, her young lover Alfredo and his father Germont in a company that has the Royal Opera Chorus and dancers to bring alive the indulgent social whirl of 19th-century Paris. With Verdi's music under the batons of three expert conductors and with the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, this Season's performances will again show just why this opera and this production have become such surefire successes with audiences every time.</SHOWLONG>

<SHOWNAME>The Nutcracker- Royal Ballet</SHOWNAME>
<SHOWSHORT>A magician with secrets, an enchanted gift, a guiding angel and a journey to the Kingdom of Sweets. The seasonal favourite The Nutcracker draws on all the imagination and fantasy of ETA Hoffmann's story of Christmas Eve, when young Clara creeps downstairs for one of her presents, but finds herself instead at the start of a night of magical adventures.</SHOWSHORT>
<SHOWLONG>A magician with secrets, an enchanted gift, a guiding angel and a journey to the Kingdom of Sweets. The seasonal favourite The Nutcracker draws on all the imagination and fantasy of ETA Hoffmann's story of Christmas Eve, when young Clara creeps downstairs for one of her presents, but finds herself instead at the start of a night of magical adventures. 
The designs for this now-classic Royal Ballet production re-create a 19th century image of Christmas, including the decorated tree that magically grows and the toy soldiers that come to life to fight the Mouse King. The beautifully coloured imaginings of the fantasy Sugar Garden and its celebratory dances make a fabulous contrast - the Sugar Plum Fairy is just one of the delights you will discover here - and Peter Wright's production tells the story clearly from its mysterious start to its happy conclusion. Tchaikovsky's music is some of the most instantly memorable in all ballet, with a wealth of famous melodies, conducted here by Barry Wordsworth, Music Director of The Royal Ballet, and Dominic Grier. 
The Nutcracker is classical ballet at its most approachable and visually entrancing, with something for everyone to enjoy, from the youngest in the family to the oldest - a Christmas present that brings a special magic each year it returns.</SHOWLONG>

<SHOWNAME>La Sonnambula</SHOWNAME>
<SHOWSHORT>La Sonnambula returns to The Royal Opera for the first time since 2002 in a production that brings out a layer of pyschological richness that may surprise those who only know the stunning musical highlights.</SHOWSHORT>
<SHOWLONG>When a story of innocence, love and marriage is matched with the appeal of Italian bel canto singing, it is a recipe for success. Bellini's La Sonnambula was an international hit of its time with music that encapsulates the thrill of the operatic voice at extremes - from the smoothly lyrical to the brilliantly virtuosic. 
It returns to The Royal Opera for the first time since 2002 in a production that brings out a layer of pyschological richness that may surprise those who only know the stunning musical highlights. In a beautiful alpine setting that evokes the world of Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain, it is not just Amina who has to prove her innocence after a compromising case of sleepwalking, but her fiance Elvino too, who must prove himself worthy to marry her. This is an opera for the very best of fine Italianate singing, and this revival is fortunate to have Eglise Gutierrez and Celso Albelo - both acclaimed in this repertory - as Amina and Elvino, the couple about to be married. 
The entire Company and the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House are under the baton of Daniel Oren, internationally known for his interpretations of Italian opera, and the final ingredient of a bel canto treat.</SHOWLONG>

<SHOWLONG>The celebrated Ealing comedy, The Ladykillers, comes to life on stage this Autumn in a hilarious and thrilling new adaption by Graham Linehan (Father Ted) and directed by Sean Foley (The Play What I Wrote).
Featuring a stellar cast of some of the finest stage and screen comedy actors including BAFTA winner Peter Capaldi (The Thick of It) as Professor Marcus alongside James Fleet (The Vicar of Dibley), Ben Miller (The Armstrong and Miller Show), Stephen Wight (Evening Standard Outstanding Newcomer) and Olivier Award winner Clive Rowe, with Marcia Warren as the sweetly innocent Mrs Wilberforce.
The Ladykillers is a classic black comedy; a sweet little old lady, alone in her house, is pitted against a gang of criminal misfits who will stop at nothing. 
Posing as amateur musicians, Professor Marcus and his gang rent rooms in the lopsided house of sweet but strict Mrs Wilberforce. The villains plot to involve her, unwittingly, in Marcus' brilliantly conceived heist job. The police are left stumped but Mrs Wilberforce becomes wise to their ruse and Marcus concludes that there is only one way to keep the old lady quiet. With only her parrot, General Gordon, to help her, Mrs W. is alone with five desperate men. But who will be forced to face the music?</SHOWLONG>

<SHOWLONG>Following its sell-out success in 2011, pop legends Pet Shop Boys and maverick choreographer Javier De Frutos bring the acclaimed Sadler's Wells collaboration, The Most Incredible Thing, back to the main stage. 
This modern fairytale based on Hans Christian Andersen's fable, adapted by Matthew Dunster, centres on a contest to produce 'the most incredible thing', with a prize of half the kingdom and marriage to the princess at stake. 
Created by an impressive team including long-time Pet Shop Boys collaborator Sven Helbig, Tony Award-winning designer Katrina Lindsay (Les Liaisons Dangereuses), and BAFTA-winning film animator, Tal Rosner, The Most Incredible Thing also features a 26-piece orchestra and a talented cast of 16 dancers. 
As the planet's most successful pop duo, the Pet Shop Boys have sold over 100 million records worldwide and amassed 22 top 10 hits, three Brit Awards and six Grammy nominations, but this new production signalled their first foray into composing for dance- if you missed it last time, this is your chance to see one of the most talked about cultural events of 2011.</SHOWLONG>

<SHOWLONG>Tim Albery's Olivier-nominated production of Wagner's opera was new in the 2008/9 Season, and is back early in this one with a special musical highlight too: the return of Jeffrey Tate to the Royal Opera House to conduct a score that utilizes the brilliance and richness of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House to the full. 
Anja Kampe comes back to the role of Senta- for which she was also Olivier-nominated- the young woman desperate to leave her unfulfilling life in an isolated Baltic port. The mysterious Dutchman, this time to be sung by leading Wagner interpreter Falk Struckmann, seems to offer escape to Senta. 
The production itself is dark and intense, to match the psychological themes of longing and denial, hope and redemption. Visually imposing, Michael Levine's set designs evoke the elemental forces of nature and the towering hulks of the ships that do daily battle with them. Driving it on is Wagner's magnificent score which utilizes a world-class cast and the large Royal Opera Chorus to the full for an absorbing drama and a thrilling operatic experience.</SHOWLONG>

<SHOWLONG>The first mixed programme of the Season gives a wonderful contrast of emotions and styles through works by three of The Royal Ballet's resident choreographers. 
The return of Limen, new in the 2009/10 Season, combinesthe energetic and demanding style of Wayne McGregor with the startling visuals of Tatsuo Miyajima's LED sculptures and projections and Kaija Saariaho's cello concerto Notes on Light for sheer contemporary thrill. Frederick Ashton?s evocation of La Dame aux camelias was created for Fonteyn and Nureyev, and it has been entrusted to only a few dancers since, so this return to the repertory brings with it some exciting debuts in the demanding central roles. 
With Liszt's music, and beautiful designs, this is a Romantic work with enduring romantic appeal. Completing the programme is Kenneth MacMillan's tribute to the memory of choreographer John Cranko, Requiem. A moving work of great beauty to Faure's transcendent music - as for Limen, under the baton of Barry Wordsworth, Music Director of The Royal Ballet - it completes this programme of shifting moods with hope and serenity.</SHOWLONG>

<SHOWNAME>Backbeat</SHOWNAME>
<SHOWSHORT>Backbeat - the adaptation of the 1994 film by Iain Softley on the birth of the Beatles - will be rock 'n' rolling its way to London's Duke of York Theatre for its West End premiere from October.</SHOWSHORT>
<SHOWLONG>Backbeat - the adaptation of the 1994 film by Iain Softley on the birth of the Beatles - will be rock 'n' rolling its way to London's Duke of York Theatre for its West End premiere from October.
Backbeat is the story of how The Beatles 'became' The Beatles - when John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Pete Best and Stuart Sutcliffe embarked on their journey from the famous docks of Liverpool to search for success in the seedy red light district of Hamburg, working eight days a week, in the clubs of the tawdry Reeperbahn, performing rock 'n' roll covers night after night.
The compelling triangular relationship between the band's original bassist Stuart Sutcliffe, the striking German photographer Astrid Kirchherr whom he fell in love with, and his best friend John Lennon, became an intrinsic part of the Beatles' story - and put them on an unstoppable trajectory onto the world stage.
Stuart's struggle between his best friend and the band, Astrid and his art, makes Stuart the troubled focus of Backbeat. His death, aged only 22, in the same year that the Beatles appointed Brian Epstein as manager, signed to Parlophone Records by Sir George Martin, and released their first single 'Love Me Do', adds to the poignancy of this remarkable and vivid portrait of the early 1960's.
Backbeat features the all-time rock 'n' roll classics that the Beatles cut their teeth with - 'Twist and Shout', 'Rock 'N' Roll Music', 'Long Tall Sally', 'Please Mr Postman' and 'Money' - live on stage as performed by 'The Beatles'.
Co-written by Iain Softley and Stephen Jeffreys, with musical direction by Paul Stacey, and directed by the award-winning David Leveaux.</SHOWLONG>

However, compelled by the strange voices that haunt his beautiful young charge and a fascination with the psychic current that pervades the house, Berkeley proposes a seance, the consequences of which are catastrophic.
Set around a haunted house hemmed in by a restive, starving populace, Conor McPherson's new play weaves Ireland's troubled colonial history into a transfixing story about the search for love, the transcendental and the circularity of time. His last production for the National was the Tony Award-winning The Seafarer.</SHOWLONG>

<SHOWLONG>Christopher Hampton's first play returns to the West End after forty years.
1965. Ian is broke, lonely and bursting with lovelorn wit. Worse, he's sharing a bedsit with the beautiful, infuriating and carefree Jimmy, who chases all the skirt he can.
Just as Ian decides to give up on a London in which everyone else is having fun, the boys get a visit from Jimmy's mother. Charismatic and reckless, she opens the boys' deepest secrets and pulls them into calamitous new territory.
Hampton's witty, soulful and horribly acute play is a brilliant howl of frustration and sexuality, directed by Blanche McIntyre following her 'career-making' (New York Times) production of Accolade earlier this year.</SHOWLONG>

<SHOWLONG>A smash hit on Broadway and in Chicago, the Tony Award-winning MILLION DOLLAR QUARTET tells the electrifying story of the night ELVIS PRESLEY, JOHNNY CASH, CARL PERKINS and JERRY LEE LEWIS came together to make music, and ended up making history.
Inspired by the actual event, that took place on 4 December 1956 at Sun Records in Memphis,?this ecstatic and engaging musical is a story of fame, friendship, discovery, divided loyalties, professional jealousy and incredible music as four of the music industry's most extraordinary talents, all in their creative prime, made music together for the first and only time in their careers.
The legendary meeting was masterminded by Sun Records' founder Sam Phillips, who discovered all four of the musicians, and brought Elvis Presley (and his then girlfriend) back to the recording studio that launched him to stardom. Together with Sun Records' fast-rising new superstar Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins, who was still chasing his next big hit after writing and recording Blue Suede Shoes, the fourth member of this impromptu 'quartet' was Phillips' latest signing, Jerry Lee Lewis.
MILLION DOLLAR QUARTET features over 20 classic hits from a golden era of music including: Blue Suede Shoes, Folsom Prison Blues, Fever, Memories Are Made Of This, That's All Right, Down By The Riverside, Sixteen Tons, (There Will Be) Peace In The Valley, I Walk The Line, I Hear You Knocking, Great Balls Of Fire, Hound Dog, Riders In The Sky, See You Later Alligator and Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On.

<SHOWNAME>Manon</SHOWNAME>
<SHOWSHORT>MacMillan's three-act ballet Manon is not just one of the great showpieces of The Royal Ballet, for whom it was created, but also now of the classical ballet repertory worldwide.</SHOWSHORT>
<SHOWLONG>MacMillan's three-act ballet Manon is not just one of the great showpieces of The Royal Ballet, for whom it was created, but also now of the classical ballet repertory worldwide. 
The story itself is famous, following the trials of a young girl, Manon, torn between her impetuous love for the student Des Grieux and her desire for wealth and comfort as a kept woman of rich men. The two central roles are perfect to bring out the skill and dramatic power of any dancers, especially with MacMillan's memorable duets that expose the raw emotional currents of the doomed love affair in intense and adult fashion, and with this revival come several debuts in them from up-and-coming leading dancers of The Royal Ballet. 
The rich stage design emphasizes the life and look of the 18th century, whether at the bustling courtyard of an inn where the couple first meet or later with the louche atmosphere of a Parisian house of entertainment and its courtesans. Through it all is appealing and expressive music drawn from Massenet, skilfully woven into a ballet score that alternates the sensuous and the dramatic. A moral tale on adult themes brings real depth to the drama, but above all Manon offers a chance to enjoy the very best of world-class ballet.</SHOWLONG>

<SHOWNAME>Matthew Bourne's Nutcracker</SHOWNAME>
<SHOWSHORT>New Adventures' much loved production of Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker is back for a limited Christmas Season</SHOWSHORT>
<SHOWLONG>New Adventures' much loved production of Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker! is one of the most popular productions ever staged at Sadler's Wells. It now returns for New Adventures' recordbreaking fifth Christmas season. 
This delicious theatrical feast has family-sized helpings of Matthew Bourne's trademark wit, pathos and magical fantasy. Nutcracker! follows Clara's bittersweet journey from a hilariously bleak Christmas Eve at Dr. Dross' Orphanage, through a shimmering, ice-skating winter wonderland to the scrumptious candy kingdom of Sweetieland.
Tchaikovsky's glorious score and Anthony Ward's unforgettable sets and costumes combine with sizzling choreography to create a fresh, hip and charmingly irreverent interpretation of the traditional Christmas favourite. 
Matthew Bourne has achieved worldwide success with his imaginative new stagings of classics such as Swan Lake, The Car Man and Edward Scissorhands. His work on the hit musical, Mary Poppins won him his fifth Olivier Award. Not seen in London since the 2003/4 sell-out season, Nutcracker! is back for a strictly limited six week run.</SHOWLONG>

<SHOWLONG>After a record breaking run, E Nesbit's classic triumphantly steams back into the 'Welcome to Yorkshire theatre' at London Waterloo for a second time with performances from 16 June. London's breathtaking theatrical event is once again staged at the former Eurostar Terminal where a 1,000 seat venue has been built around the railway tracks with audience seated either side. 
The Railway Children adapted by Mike Kenny and directed by Damian Cruden has arrived; bringing with it all the power of hope, the romance of steam trains and the magic of theatrical invention. Featuring Stirling Single, a gorgeous 66-tonne steam locomotive and the Old Gentlemans's Saloon (from the original Railway Children film), join Bobbie, Peter and Phyllis as they tell their story - of joy, sadness, laughter and love.

<VENUE_DESCRIPTION>The Phoenix Theatre opened in 1930 with the premiere of Noel Coward''s Private Lives featuring Coward himself in the cast, along with Gertrude Lawrence, Adrienne Allen and a young Laurence Olivier.
Coward formed a strong association with The Phoenix returning with Gertrude Lawrence as his co-star in 1936 with the programme of the one -act play Tonight at 8.30. He returned again in 1952 with Quadrille, which opened only a few days after the death of Gertie Lawrence, and Coward wrote how difficult it was to sit through that first night in what he and Gertie had always referred to as ''our theatre''.

The Phoenix enjoyed a succession of very successful plays including John Gielgud''s Love for Love during the war, and a season featuring Paul Scofield and Peter Brook in the mid fifties. 

A new musical Canterbury Tales adapted from Chaucer''s famous book opened in 1968 and began a 2000 performance run. 

The eighties and nineties have seen many award-winning musicals, including The baker''s Wife by Stephen Schwarz (directed by Trevor Nunn) and the delightful Into the wood by Stephen Sondheim starring Julia McEnzie; as well as a very successful season of Shakespeare plays. 

The current production Blood Brothers, a musical by Willy Russell, which transferred from the Albery in 1991, is the longest running show ever at the Phoenix. 

The Building:
The theatre opened in 1930 and was beautifully designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, Bertie Crewe and Cecil Masey, with Theodore Komisarjevsky as Art Director. 

The entrance on the corner of Charing Cross Road and Flitcroft Street is a rotunda with four columns above the canopy topped by an attic with square windows. 

A change of ownership in 1966 led to a refurbishment programme, including the construction of the Noel oward bar in the Phoenix Street foyer, which was open by the great man himself in 1969. 

Respecting the tradition of the Italian theatres, the auditorium shines with golden engraves, red seats, carpet and curtains. 

Above the boxes we can admire panels by Vladimir Polunin after Tintoretto, Titian and Giorgione, and the entire safety curtain is a rendition of Jacopo del Sellaio''s The Triumph Of Love. 

Also, throughout the building, we can enjoy the sculpted wooden doors and the decorated ceilings.</VENUE_DESCRIPTION>

<SHOWLONG>NEW JOINT. SAME JAZZ. 
 
This autumn a new chapter opens in the history of Broadway's most successful show. 
Having snatched the crown of the longest running American musical from A Chorus Line, the London production of Chicago returns to the West End from 7th November at its new home; the Garrick Theatre.
Entering what will be its 15th year in London, this universal tale of fame, fortune and. all that jazz, recounts the kiss-and-tell tale of chorus girl Roxie Hart who kills her lover; her rivalry with glamorous double-murderer Velma Kelly and their slick lawyer, Billy Flynn's attempts to keep his clients from Death Row.

From the unforgettable first blast of All That Jazz right through to the last note of its sizzling jazz-drenched score and from the sensuous choreography inspired by the legendary Bob Fosse to its sensational performers, Chicago is a musical phenomenon like no other.</SHOWLONG>

An inventive and groundbreaking choreographer, Javier De Frutos returns to create a world premiere inspired by the life and work of Tennessee Williams. Set to music from A Streetcar Named Desire, this new work is De Frutos at his very best. Concluding the bill is Merce Cunningham's spellbinding RainForest, a work praised for its 'childlike gentleness' (New York Times) performed to David Tudor's evocative score.
All three works will be played live by the Rambert Orchestra.</SHOWLONG>

<SHOWLONG>The 'grand' in grand opera is right at the centre of Faust. With Angela Gheorghiu and Vittorio Grigolo among the perfomers, this star-cast revival has huge forces on stage in a fantastic production with lavish designs. 
David McVicar's wonderfully indulgent interpretation brings to life what was once the most famous and most performed opera of all, in which Faust sells his soul to the demon Mephistopheles in exchange for youth, and then is tempted by the innocent beauty of Marguerite. In this vivid, large-scale staging it is a truly theatrical battle of good and evil, spiced with fated romance. 
Gounod's opera is renowned for its many hit numbers, whether the dazzling coloratura of Marguerite's 'Jewel Song' waltz, the instantly memorable Soldiers' Chorus or the impassioned climactic trio between Marguerite, Mephistopheles and Faust. Complete with the Act IV ballet taking a bravura twist and Evelino Pido conducting the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House and the large forces of the Royal Opera Chorus, this revival of Faust brings together everything that made this 19th-century opera a worldwide phenomenon.</SHOWLONG>

<SHOWLONG>The Sleeping Beauty has become a much-loved classical ballet and a perennial delight that combines in a single work all the charms and virtuosity that ballet has to offer. 
First choreographed to Tchaikovsky's great musical score by Petipa in 1890 in Russia, it has wonderful ensembles such as the famous Waltz, solos including the Rose Adage as Aurora meets her suitors, and of course the concluding celebratory dances for the happy union of prince and princess. 
The Royal Ballet's staging is the distinctive production by Ninette de Valois, revived for the 75th anniversary celebrations of The Royal Ballet in 2006. Its style and visual splendour are unique to the Company: luscious designs by Oliver Messel, restored and updated by Peter Farmer, are richly colourful in their evocation of the opulent Baroque splendour of the royal court, the panoramic journey of the Prince to the overgrown castle and the colourful characters of this famous fairytale. 
The Sleeping Beauty brings together the best of classical ballet, its music, its dancers and The Royal Ballet itself.</SHOWLONG>

<SHOWNAME>Jerusalem</SHOWNAME>
<SHOWSHORT>Mark Rylance and Mackenzie Cook star in the critically acclaimed Jerusalem, which returns to the West End after an award winning run on Broadway.</SHOWSHORT>
<SHOWLONG>Age recommendation: 14+ 
A comic, contemporary vision of rural life in our green and pleasant land, Jez Butterworth's epic new play is wildly original. In part a lament about the erosion of country life and in part a rebuff to the antiseptic modern world, it features a landmark central performance from Mark Rylance as hellraiser Johnny Byron, 'a performance so charismatic, so mercurial, so complete and compelling that it doesn't look like acting' (ES), and a superb ensemble cast including Mackenzie Crook who 'excels' as Johnny's sidekick Ginger. 
On St George's Day, the morning of the local county fair, Johnny Byron is a wanted man. The council officials want to serve him an eviction notice, his son wants his dad to take him to the fair, and a motley crew of mates want his ample supply of drugs and alcohol.</SHOWLONG>

<VENUE_DESCRIPTION>The Phoenix Theatre opened in 1930 with the premiere of Noel Coward''s Private Lives featuring Coward himself in the cast, along with Gertrude Lawrence, Adrienne Allen and a young Laurence Olivier.
Coward formed a strong association with The Phoenix returning with Gertrude Lawrence as his co-star in 1936 with the programme of the one -act play Tonight at 8.30. He returned again in 1952 with Quadrille, which opened only a few days after the death of Gertie Lawrence, and Coward wrote how difficult it was to sit through that first night in what he and Gertie had always referred to as ''our theatre''.

The Phoenix enjoyed a succession of very successful plays including John Gielgud''s Love for Love during the war, and a season featuring Paul Scofield and Peter Brook in the mid fifties. 

A new musical Canterbury Tales adapted from Chaucer''s famous book opened in 1968 and began a 2000 performance run. 

The eighties and nineties have seen many award-winning musicals, including The baker''s Wife by Stephen Schwarz (directed by Trevor Nunn) and the delightful Into the wood by Stephen Sondheim starring Julia McEnzie; as well as a very successful season of Shakespeare plays. 

The current production Blood Brothers, a musical by Willy Russell, which transferred from the Albery in 1991, is the longest running show ever at the Phoenix. 

The Building:
The theatre opened in 1930 and was beautifully designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, Bertie Crewe and Cecil Masey, with Theodore Komisarjevsky as Art Director. 

The entrance on the corner of Charing Cross Road and Flitcroft Street is a rotunda with four columns above the canopy topped by an attic with square windows. 

A change of ownership in 1966 led to a refurbishment programme, including the construction of the Noel oward bar in the Phoenix Street foyer, which was open by the great man himself in 1969. 

Respecting the tradition of the Italian theatres, the auditorium shines with golden engraves, red seats, carpet and curtains. 

Above the boxes we can admire panels by Vladimir Polunin after Tintoretto, Titian and Giorgione, and the entire safety curtain is a rendition of Jacopo del Sellaio''s The Triumph Of Love. 

Also, throughout the building, we can enjoy the sculpted wooden doors and the decorated ceilings.</VENUE_DESCRIPTION>

The legendary meeting was masterminded by Sun Records' founder Sam Phillips, who discovered all four of the musicians, and brought Elvis Presley (and his then girlfriend) back to the recording studio that launched him to stardom. Together with Sun Records' fast-rising new superstar Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins, who was still chasing his next big hit after writing and recording Blue Suede Shoes, the fourth member of this impromptu 'quartet' was Phillips' latest signing, Jerry Lee Lewis.
MILLION DOLLAR QUARTET features over 20 classic hits from a golden era of music including: Blue Suede Shoes, Folsom Prison Blues, Fever, Memories Are Made Of This, That's All Right, Down By The Riverside, Sixteen Tons, (There Will Be) Peace In The Valley, I Walk The Line, I Hear You Knocking, Great Balls Of Fire, Hound Dog, Riders In The Sky, See You Later Alligator and Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On.

<VENUE_DESCRIPTION>The Phoenix Theatre opened in 1930 with the premiere of Noel Coward''s Private Lives featuring Coward himself in the cast, along with Gertrude Lawrence, Adrienne Allen and a young Laurence Olivier.
Coward formed a strong association with The Phoenix returning with Gertrude Lawrence as his co-star in 1936 with the programme of the one -act play Tonight at 8.30. He returned again in 1952 with Quadrille, which opened only a few days after the death of Gertie Lawrence, and Coward wrote how difficult it was to sit through that first night in what he and Gertie had always referred to as ''our theatre''.

The Phoenix enjoyed a succession of very successful plays including John Gielgud''s Love for Love during the war, and a season featuring Paul Scofield and Peter Brook in the mid fifties. 

A new musical Canterbury Tales adapted from Chaucer''s famous book opened in 1968 and began a 2000 performance run. 

The eighties and nineties have seen many award-winning musicals, including The baker''s Wife by Stephen Schwarz (directed by Trevor Nunn) and the delightful Into the wood by Stephen Sondheim starring Julia McEnzie; as well as a very successful season of Shakespeare plays. 

The current production Blood Brothers, a musical by Willy Russell, which transferred from the Albery in 1991, is the longest running show ever at the Phoenix. 

The Building:
The theatre opened in 1930 and was beautifully designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, Bertie Crewe and Cecil Masey, with Theodore Komisarjevsky as Art Director. 

The entrance on the corner of Charing Cross Road and Flitcroft Street is a rotunda with four columns above the canopy topped by an attic with square windows. 

A change of ownership in 1966 led to a refurbishment programme, including the construction of the Noel oward bar in the Phoenix Street foyer, which was open by the great man himself in 1969. 

Respecting the tradition of the Italian theatres, the auditorium shines with golden engraves, red seats, carpet and curtains. 

Above the boxes we can admire panels by Vladimir Polunin after Tintoretto, Titian and Giorgione, and the entire safety curtain is a rendition of Jacopo del Sellaio''s The Triumph Of Love. 

Also, throughout the building, we can enjoy the sculpted wooden doors and the decorated ceilings.</VENUE_DESCRIPTION>

<VENUE_DESCRIPTION>The Phoenix Theatre opened in 1930 with the premiere of Noel Coward''s Private Lives featuring Coward himself in the cast, along with Gertrude Lawrence, Adrienne Allen and a young Laurence Olivier.
Coward formed a strong association with The Phoenix returning with Gertrude Lawrence as his co-star in 1936 with the programme of the one -act play Tonight at 8.30. He returned again in 1952 with Quadrille, which opened only a few days after the death of Gertie Lawrence, and Coward wrote how difficult it was to sit through that first night in what he and Gertie had always referred to as ''our theatre''.

The Phoenix enjoyed a succession of very successful plays including John Gielgud''s Love for Love during the war, and a season featuring Paul Scofield and Peter Brook in the mid fifties. 

A new musical Canterbury Tales adapted from Chaucer''s famous book opened in 1968 and began a 2000 performance run. 

The eighties and nineties have seen many award-winning musicals, including The baker''s Wife by Stephen Schwarz (directed by Trevor Nunn) and the delightful Into the wood by Stephen Sondheim starring Julia McEnzie; as well as a very successful season of Shakespeare plays. 

The current production Blood Brothers, a musical by Willy Russell, which transferred from the Albery in 1991, is the longest running show ever at the Phoenix. 

The Building:
The theatre opened in 1930 and was beautifully designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, Bertie Crewe and Cecil Masey, with Theodore Komisarjevsky as Art Director. 

The entrance on the corner of Charing Cross Road and Flitcroft Street is a rotunda with four columns above the canopy topped by an attic with square windows. 

A change of ownership in 1966 led to a refurbishment programme, including the construction of the Noel oward bar in the Phoenix Street foyer, which was open by the great man himself in 1969. 

Respecting the tradition of the Italian theatres, the auditorium shines with golden engraves, red seats, carpet and curtains. 

Above the boxes we can admire panels by Vladimir Polunin after Tintoretto, Titian and Giorgione, and the entire safety curtain is a rendition of Jacopo del Sellaio''s The Triumph Of Love. 

Also, throughout the building, we can enjoy the sculpted wooden doors and the decorated ceilings.</VENUE_DESCRIPTION>

<SHOWLONG>NEW JOINT. SAME JAZZ. 
 
This autumn a new chapter opens in the history of Broadway's most successful show. 
Having snatched the crown of the longest running American musical from A Chorus Line, the London production of Chicago returns to the West End from 7th November at its new home; the Garrick Theatre.
Entering what will be its 15th year in London, this universal tale of fame, fortune and. all that jazz, recounts the kiss-and-tell tale of chorus girl Roxie Hart who kills her lover; her rivalry with glamorous double-murderer Velma Kelly and their slick lawyer, Billy Flynn's attempts to keep his clients from Death Row.

From the unforgettable first blast of All That Jazz right through to the last note of its sizzling jazz-drenched score and from the sensuous choreography inspired by the legendary Bob Fosse to its sensational performers, Chicago is a musical phenomenon like no other.</SHOWLONG>

<SHOWNAME>Office Party</SHOWNAME>
<SHOWSHORT>After sell-out runs at the Barbican Theatre and the Edinburgh Fringe, the show that's a party is back!</SHOWSHORT>
<SHOWLONG>Tired of the same old boring office party?
Then let yourself be entertained by legendary cabaret artists Ursula Martinez (La Clique, La Soiree) and Christopher Green (Tina C, Ida Barr) as they invite you to their very own scandalous Office Party. After sell-out runs at the Barbican Theatre and the Edinburgh Fringe, the show that's a party is back!
Martinez and Green, who collaborated together in the Olivier-Award winning (C'est Duckie!), bring you an interactive theatrical extravaganza which features a veritable smorgasbord of stand-up comedians, and stupendously brilliant avant-garde performers. Whatever your profession; doctor or digger, taxidermist or taxi driver, take a journey around our purpose-built office where the fun will be waiting for you. Get ready for the most wonderfully experimental Christmas party on offer! There will be possible professional embarrassment, but don't worry, what happens at the office party, stays at the office party. Please Note: this is a promenade performance and the audience will move about within the venue. There is no formal seating, however there will be some chairs available for those wo may wish to sit down at some point.
Patrons must be aged 18 years and over to gain admittance.</SHOWLONG>

<SHOWLONG>A smash hit on Broadway and in Chicago, the Tony Award-winning MILLION DOLLAR QUARTET tells the electrifying story of the night ELVIS PRESLEY, JOHNNY CASH, CARL PERKINS and JERRY LEE LEWIS came together to make music, and ended up making history.
Inspired by the actual event, that took place on 4 December 1956 at Sun Records in Memphis,?this ecstatic and engaging musical is a story of fame, friendship, discovery, divided loyalties, professional jealousy and incredible music as four of the music industry's most extraordinary talents, all in their creative prime, made music together for the first and only time in their careers.
The legendary meeting was masterminded by Sun Records' founder Sam Phillips, who discovered all four of the musicians, and brought Elvis Presley (and his then girlfriend) back to the recording studio that launched him to stardom. Together with Sun Records' fast-rising new superstar Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins, who was still chasing his next big hit after writing and recording Blue Suede Shoes, the fourth member of this impromptu 'quartet' was Phillips' latest signing, Jerry Lee Lewis.
MILLION DOLLAR QUARTET features over 20 classic hits from a golden era of music including: Blue Suede Shoes, Folsom Prison Blues, Fever, Memories Are Made Of This, That's All Right, Down By The Riverside, Sixteen Tons, (There Will Be) Peace In The Valley, I Walk The Line, I Hear You Knocking, Great Balls Of Fire, Hound Dog, Riders In The Sky, See You Later Alligator and Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On.

<SHOWLONG>A smash hit on Broadway and in Chicago, the Tony Award-winning MILLION DOLLAR QUARTET tells the electrifying story of the night ELVIS PRESLEY, JOHNNY CASH, CARL PERKINS and JERRY LEE LEWIS came together to make music, and ended up making history.
Inspired by the actual event, that took place on 4 December 1956 at Sun Records in Memphis,?this ecstatic and engaging musical is a story of fame, friendship, discovery, divided loyalties, professional jealousy and incredible music as four of the music industry's most extraordinary talents, all in their creative prime, made music together for the first and only time in their careers.
The legendary meeting was masterminded by Sun Records' founder Sam Phillips, who discovered all four of the musicians, and brought Elvis Presley (and his then girlfriend) back to the recording studio that launched him to stardom. Together with Sun Records' fast-rising new superstar Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins, who was still chasing his next big hit after writing and recording Blue Suede Shoes, the fourth member of this impromptu 'quartet' was Phillips' latest signing, Jerry Lee Lewis.
MILLION DOLLAR QUARTET features over 20 classic hits from a golden era of music including: Blue Suede Shoes, Folsom Prison Blues, Fever, Memories Are Made Of This, That's All Right, Down By The Riverside, Sixteen Tons, (There Will Be) Peace In The Valley, I Walk The Line, I Hear You Knocking, Great Balls Of Fire, Hound Dog, Riders In The Sky, See You Later Alligator and Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On.

<SHOWNAME>Backbeat</SHOWNAME>
<SHOWSHORT>Backbeat - the adaptation of the 1994 film by Iain Softley on the birth of the Beatles - will be rock 'n' rolling its way to London's Duke of York Theatre for its West End premiere from October.</SHOWSHORT>
<SHOWLONG>Backbeat - the adaptation of the 1994 film by Iain Softley on the birth of the Beatles - will be rock 'n' rolling its way to London's Duke of York Theatre for its West End premiere from October.
Backbeat is the story of how The Beatles 'became' The Beatles - when John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Pete Best and Stuart Sutcliffe embarked on their journey from the famous docks of Liverpool to search for success in the seedy red light district of Hamburg, working eight days a week, in the clubs of the tawdry Reeperbahn, performing rock 'n' roll covers night after night.
The compelling triangular relationship between the band's original bassist Stuart Sutcliffe, the striking German photographer Astrid Kirchherr whom he fell in love with, and his best friend John Lennon, became an intrinsic part of the Beatles' story - and put them on an unstoppable trajectory onto the world stage.
Stuart's struggle between his best friend and the band, Astrid and his art, makes Stuart the troubled focus of Backbeat. His death, aged only 22, in the same year that the Beatles appointed Brian Epstein as manager, signed to Parlophone Records by Sir George Martin, and released their first single 'Love Me Do', adds to the poignancy of this remarkable and vivid portrait of the early 1960's.
Backbeat features the all-time rock 'n' roll classics that the Beatles cut their teeth with - 'Twist and Shout', 'Rock 'N' Roll Music', 'Long Tall Sally', 'Please Mr Postman' and 'Money' - live on stage as performed by 'The Beatles'.
Co-written by Iain Softley and Stephen Jeffreys, with musical direction by Paul Stacey, and directed by the award-winning David Leveaux.</SHOWLONG>

<SHOWLONG>NEW JOINT. SAME JAZZ. 
 
This autumn a new chapter opens in the history of Broadway's most successful show. 
Having snatched the crown of the longest running American musical from A Chorus Line, the London production of Chicago returns to the West End from 7th November at its new home; the Garrick Theatre.
Entering what will be its 15th year in London, this universal tale of fame, fortune and. all that jazz, recounts the kiss-and-tell tale of chorus girl Roxie Hart who kills her lover; her rivalry with glamorous double-murderer Velma Kelly and their slick lawyer, Billy Flynn's attempts to keep his clients from Death Row.

From the unforgettable first blast of All That Jazz right through to the last note of its sizzling jazz-drenched score and from the sensuous choreography inspired by the legendary Bob Fosse to its sensational performers, Chicago is a musical phenomenon like no other.</SHOWLONG>

<VENUE_DESCRIPTION>The Phoenix Theatre opened in 1930 with the premiere of Noel Coward''s Private Lives featuring Coward himself in the cast, along with Gertrude Lawrence, Adrienne Allen and a young Laurence Olivier.
Coward formed a strong association with The Phoenix returning with Gertrude Lawrence as his co-star in 1936 with the programme of the one -act play Tonight at 8.30. He returned again in 1952 with Quadrille, which opened only a few days after the death of Gertie Lawrence, and Coward wrote how difficult it was to sit through that first night in what he and Gertie had always referred to as ''our theatre''.

The Phoenix enjoyed a succession of very successful plays including John Gielgud''s Love for Love during the war, and a season featuring Paul Scofield and Peter Brook in the mid fifties. 

A new musical Canterbury Tales adapted from Chaucer''s famous book opened in 1968 and began a 2000 performance run. 

The eighties and nineties have seen many award-winning musicals, including The baker''s Wife by Stephen Schwarz (directed by Trevor Nunn) and the delightful Into the wood by Stephen Sondheim starring Julia McEnzie; as well as a very successful season of Shakespeare plays. 

The current production Blood Brothers, a musical by Willy Russell, which transferred from the Albery in 1991, is the longest running show ever at the Phoenix. 

The Building:
The theatre opened in 1930 and was beautifully designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, Bertie Crewe and Cecil Masey, with Theodore Komisarjevsky as Art Director. 

The entrance on the corner of Charing Cross Road and Flitcroft Street is a rotunda with four columns above the canopy topped by an attic with square windows. 

A change of ownership in 1966 led to a refurbishment programme, including the construction of the Noel oward bar in the Phoenix Street foyer, which was open by the great man himself in 1969. 

Respecting the tradition of the Italian theatres, the auditorium shines with golden engraves, red seats, carpet and curtains. 

Above the boxes we can admire panels by Vladimir Polunin after Tintoretto, Titian and Giorgione, and the entire safety curtain is a rendition of Jacopo del Sellaio''s The Triumph Of Love. 

Also, throughout the building, we can enjoy the sculpted wooden doors and the decorated ceilings.</VENUE_DESCRIPTION>

<VENUE_DESCRIPTION>The Phoenix Theatre opened in 1930 with the premiere of Noel Coward''s Private Lives featuring Coward himself in the cast, along with Gertrude Lawrence, Adrienne Allen and a young Laurence Olivier.
Coward formed a strong association with The Phoenix returning with Gertrude Lawrence as his co-star in 1936 with the programme of the one -act play Tonight at 8.30. He returned again in 1952 with Quadrille, which opened only a few days after the death of Gertie Lawrence, and Coward wrote how difficult it was to sit through that first night in what he and Gertie had always referred to as ''our theatre''.

The Phoenix enjoyed a succession of very successful plays including John Gielgud''s Love for Love during the war, and a season featuring Paul Scofield and Peter Brook in the mid fifties. 

A new musical Canterbury Tales adapted from Chaucer''s famous book opened in 1968 and began a 2000 performance run. 

The eighties and nineties have seen many award-winning musicals, including The baker''s Wife by Stephen Schwarz (directed by Trevor Nunn) and the delightful Into the wood by Stephen Sondheim starring Julia McEnzie; as well as a very successful season of Shakespeare plays. 

The current production Blood Brothers, a musical by Willy Russell, which transferred from the Albery in 1991, is the longest running show ever at the Phoenix. 

The Building:
The theatre opened in 1930 and was beautifully designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, Bertie Crewe and Cecil Masey, with Theodore Komisarjevsky as Art Director. 

The entrance on the corner of Charing Cross Road and Flitcroft Street is a rotunda with four columns above the canopy topped by an attic with square windows. 

A change of ownership in 1966 led to a refurbishment programme, including the construction of the Noel oward bar in the Phoenix Street foyer, which was open by the great man himself in 1969. 

Respecting the tradition of the Italian theatres, the auditorium shines with golden engraves, red seats, carpet and curtains. 

Above the boxes we can admire panels by Vladimir Polunin after Tintoretto, Titian and Giorgione, and the entire safety curtain is a rendition of Jacopo del Sellaio''s The Triumph Of Love. 

Also, throughout the building, we can enjoy the sculpted wooden doors and the decorated ceilings.</VENUE_DESCRIPTION>

<SHOWLONG>A smash hit on Broadway and in Chicago, the Tony Award-winning MILLION DOLLAR QUARTET tells the electrifying story of the night ELVIS PRESLEY, JOHNNY CASH, CARL PERKINS and JERRY LEE LEWIS came together to make music, and ended up making history.
Inspired by the actual event, that took place on 4 December 1956 at Sun Records in Memphis,?this ecstatic and engaging musical is a story of fame, friendship, discovery, divided loyalties, professional jealousy and incredible music as four of the music industry's most extraordinary talents, all in their creative prime, made music together for the first and only time in their careers.
The legendary meeting was masterminded by Sun Records' founder Sam Phillips, who discovered all four of the musicians, and brought Elvis Presley (and his then girlfriend) back to the recording studio that launched him to stardom. Together with Sun Records' fast-rising new superstar Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins, who was still chasing his next big hit after writing and recording Blue Suede Shoes, the fourth member of this impromptu 'quartet' was Phillips' latest signing, Jerry Lee Lewis.
MILLION DOLLAR QUARTET features over 20 classic hits from a golden era of music including: Blue Suede Shoes, Folsom Prison Blues, Fever, Memories Are Made Of This, That's All Right, Down By The Riverside, Sixteen Tons, (There Will Be) Peace In The Valley, I Walk The Line, I Hear You Knocking, Great Balls Of Fire, Hound Dog, Riders In The Sky, See You Later Alligator and Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On.

<SHOWLONG>A smash hit on Broadway and in Chicago, the Tony Award-winning MILLION DOLLAR QUARTET tells the electrifying story of the night ELVIS PRESLEY, JOHNNY CASH, CARL PERKINS and JERRY LEE LEWIS came together to make music, and ended up making history.
Inspired by the actual event, that took place on 4 December 1956 at Sun Records in Memphis,?this ecstatic and engaging musical is a story of fame, friendship, discovery, divided loyalties, professional jealousy and incredible music as four of the music industry's most extraordinary talents, all in their creative prime, made music together for the first and only time in their careers.
The legendary meeting was masterminded by Sun Records' founder Sam Phillips, who discovered all four of the musicians, and brought Elvis Presley (and his then girlfriend) back to the recording studio that launched him to stardom. Together with Sun Records' fast-rising new superstar Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins, who was still chasing his next big hit after writing and recording Blue Suede Shoes, the fourth member of this impromptu 'quartet' was Phillips' latest signing, Jerry Lee Lewis.
MILLION DOLLAR QUARTET features over 20 classic hits from a golden era of music including: Blue Suede Shoes, Folsom Prison Blues, Fever, Memories Are Made Of This, That's All Right, Down By The Riverside, Sixteen Tons, (There Will Be) Peace In The Valley, I Walk The Line, I Hear You Knocking, Great Balls Of Fire, Hound Dog, Riders In The Sky, See You Later Alligator and Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On.

<SHOWSHORT>Based on the Academy Award winning film, GHOST The Musical is a timeless fantasy about the power of love.</SHOWSHORT>
<SHOWLONG>Believe In Love
GHOST is a timeless fantasy about the power of love. Sam is trapped as a ghost between this world and the next trying to communicate with his girlfriend Molly through a phoney psychic in the hope of saving her from his murderer.
A roller-coaster ride of romance, drama and excitement, GHOST has been adapted for the stage by Bruce Joel Rubin who, in 1991, won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. GHOST features stunning new music and lyrics by music legends Dave Stewart (Eurythmics) and Glen Ballard (writer of Michael Jackson's Man In The Mirror) whose combined album sales top 250 million: the score also features the unforgettable Unchained Melody.
Directed by the multi-award-winning Matthew Warchus, designed by Rob Howell with lighting by Hugh Vanstone: a team whose recent credits include God of Carnage, Deathtrap, La Bete and range from work in opera, film and with all of our major theatre companies, including the recent highly-acclaimed Matilda for the RSC. Stage effects are by Magic Circle member, Paul Kieve, illusionist for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and choreography is by Ashley Wallen, who has worked with Kylie Minogue, Black Eyed Peas and X Factor.
GHOST is a magical night out that will send spirits soaring.</SHOWLONG>
